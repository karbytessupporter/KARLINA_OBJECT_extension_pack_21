This C++ program computes the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers and prints the steps involved.

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 10.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 9.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B is the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 10, B = 9, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 1.

step_1: A = 9, B = 1, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 1

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 20.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 10.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B is the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 20, B = 10, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 10

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 278.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 512.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B is the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 278, B = 512, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 278.

step_1: A = 512, B = 278, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 234.

step_2: A = 278, B = 234, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 44.

step_3: A = 234, B = 44, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 14.

step_4: A = 44, B = 14, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 2.

step_5: A = 14, B = 2, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 2

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 1024.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 512.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B is the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 1024, B = 512, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 512

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 999.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 81.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B is the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 999, B = 81, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 27.

step_1: A = 81, B = 27, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 27

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is -11.

A has been reset to 1 due to the fact that the input value for A was either less than one or else greater than 10000.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is -11.

B has been reset to 1 due to the fact that the input value for B was either less than one or else greater than 10000.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B is the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 1, B = 1, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 1
