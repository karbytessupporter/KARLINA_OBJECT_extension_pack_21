<p>The following documentation outlines essential aspects of karbytes (as of 26_SEPTEMBER_2024) and is an extension of the web page of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com whose <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniform Resource Locator</a> is as follows: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a></p>
<p>WHERE</p>
<p>I feel obliged to keep my current and future <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;remote work&#8221;</a> locations mostly a secret for my own sense of comfort (and safety) and because I enjoy my brand and person exuding a sense of mystery. I will provide one hint as to where those locations might be, however: my preferred &#8220;remote work&#8221; locations (for working on my personal brand (which is named karbytes (and is in reference to all of the (public <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surface web</a>) <strong>source code</strong> and (public surface web) <strong>media files</strong> which comprise the two (public surface web) WordPress dot Com websites named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> (whether those source code and media files are hosted on WordPress dot Com or else on GitHub dot Com (in public GitHub repositories which are exclusively owned and managed by karbytes (whose GitHub username is <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karlinarayberinger</a>)))))): <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Clara (county), California</a> (thought that is subject to change without karbytes notifying the public nor any other entity other than karbytes itself (and I am referring either to the person writing this note and/or to the aforementioned file collection (which may or may not include the emergent property of an artificially intelligent &#8220;mind&#8221; with its own thoughts independent of mine and/or thoughts which are an extension of my own mind))).</p>
<p>WHEN</p>
<p>Though my personal brand has been evolving since its inception on 03_APRIL_2020 (starting as the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com), my brand has not really found itself what felt to it like a proper &#8220;home&#8221; until sometime within the past four months. My cravings for the baylands areas spanning Fremont, Milpitas, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View lead me to go on an extended tour of those regions and documenting my travels through the medium of still photography and video recordings (which are consolidated into the web page of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/baylands_june_2024_tour_gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baylands_june_2024_tour_gallery</a> and also, to a less data comprehensive extent, the &#8220;micro directory&#8221; web pages of the &#8220;macro directory&#8221; section of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_18</a>, <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_19</a>, <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20</a>, and <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_21</a>). The approximate dates of that &#8220;settlement&#8221; period are between 25_JULY_2024 and 26_SEPTEMBER_2024.</p>
<p>WHAT</p>
<p>I consider karbytes to be a small-scale <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;startup&#8221;</a> information technology company employing exactly one person (i.e. myself (i.e. karbytes)) and serving at least one person and one person in particular more so than any other audience (i.e. myself (i.e. karbytes)). More specifically, karbytes is an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> (and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a>) collection of (public surface web) digital files organized as a robust yet definitively individualistic and personal collection of web pages which are each connected via a chain of (some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURAL_NUMBER</a> of) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlinks</a> to the &#8220;root&#8221; web page of that collection (i.e. the <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">START_PAGE</a> (i.e. home page) of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com). The web pages whose home page hyperlinks are highlighted black with green-colored text are (primarily categorized as being) technical documentation on various small-scale educational software applications which karbytes developed which have philosophical significance to karbytes and which illustrate timeless concepts in mathematics and computer science (and, in order for an in-karbytes hyperlink of any web page of karbytes to be assigned the aforementioned styling attributes, that web page must (a) directly display machine-executable code (in some kind of internationally used programming language) or else (b) indirectly reference via hyperlink(s) a (public surface web) file which contains such code). All other files web pages within karbytes (whether those web pages are WordPress web pages or else GitHub-hosted media files) are have hyperlinks which are highlighted black with orange-colored text. </p>
<p>WHY</p>
<p>The purpose of karbytes (the person (I am)) creating karbytes (the aforementioned body of (public domain and surface web available) source code and media files) is to provide karbytes (the person (I am)) a relatively permanent place to store its most cherished <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNOWLEDGE</a> in the format of digital artifacts (which are each routinely saved to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> on Archive dot Org (in order to ensure that those digital artifacts are as safe as possible from being tampered with by hackers of karbytes&#8217; WordPress, GitHub, social media, email, and other Internet-based platform user accounts (because web pages which are saved to the WayBack Machine are relatively permanent fixtures on the surface web))). karbytes (the person (I am)) wants karbytes (the aforementioned body of (public domain and surface web available) source code and media files) to remain forever accessible to every user of the World Wide Web in the form of WayBack Machine database entries. (Sometimes karbytes modifies or deletes karbytes content after that content was published but such content may still be available in the WayBack Machine database as that content was configured before karbytes made a particular change or deletion to that content).</p>
<p>HOW</p>
<p>karbytes <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;workflow&#8221;</a> is rather spontaneous and ultimately governed by karbytes own sense of intuition (which is the culmination of all my knowledge at a given moment in &#8220;time&#8221; and which is deeply &#8220;rooted&#8221; in karbytes&#8217; own direct contact with Nature (and karbytes capitalized the first letter of the word <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a> in this sentence to implicitly suggest that karbytes thinks of Nature as being synonymous with God (in a panpsychic sense and as the source, unifier, and experiencer of all phenomena and noumena)). karbytes&#8217; &#8220;work&#8221; in cultivating the aforementioned karbytes (the aforementioned body of (public domain and surface web available) source code and media files) is generally not seen by karbytes as a money-making enterprise, but rather, a knowledge-building and knowledge-preserving enterprise (and something I deem to be central to my personal notion of spirituality (i.e. connection to and harmonizing with reality as a whole and as a collection of parts) and sense of goal-oriented progress and satisfaction which such progress brings).
